# 4Sight job search webstie

This is my senior graduation project for Hillcrest Highschool. This project is to help newly college graduates to find a job based upon their skills in their resume. How this works is that the user puts in the location they are looking to find a job, Then they upload in their resume so that the website would parse said resumeT Once the website has parsed the resume it looks for the most dominate skills in the resume and then using that information it scarpes LinkedIn and searches for jobs based upon that skill.once those jobs are found along with the location that the user picked it takes the links of said jobs and puts it in a screen so that the user can see the name of the company, the location, and the link to their LinkedIn job applicaiton.
